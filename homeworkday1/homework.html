        <h3><p>What do we offer that other coworking shops dont?</p></h3>
            <p>J & R isn't just a coworking shop. We are a ctreative space that caters to those wanting to find ways of expressing themselves in a very hands on sort of way. We love to share our knowledge, and encourage our members to extend out to one another and collaborate on projects and learn from eachother. We have a stage and love to jam out while working, and are happy to stop for a jam sesh in the middle of grinding burred edges or prepping a project for paint. We are in the business of connecting people, forming ideas, and creating works of art in the form you find natural.</p>
        <p>Sound pretty cool? We think so, and we'd love to show you around the shop and get you started on your next project.</p>

        <em>Johnathan</em>-78704..."This shop is the bomb! They had all the tools I needed to build my pizza oven fabrication business, and even made a deal with me so I didnt have to pay until I started making some money!"</p>
        <p>
            <em>Cameron</em>-Hyde Park Bishes..."The two guys running the shop are so helpful and want to see members and friends have fun and learn. They're willing to lend their expertise to help in your projects and show you better and safer ways to use tools. Great shop with tons of machines and tools I'd never have a chance to use if it wasn't for these guys."
